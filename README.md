Welcome to the official JSIICrew team repository!

JSIICrew team members are as follows:

Aaron Wilson - Team Lead Captain (Developer)
Jake Seever - Team Developer
Lea Trueworthy - Team Developer

Our team goal:

By the end of this nine (9) week development cycle for this project, we expect to have a greater understanding
of more advanced JS Development concepts. Also to have more experience at team building and working on a project 
as a cohesive team. 

Our project:

A SPA (Single Page Application) that is a JavaScript trivia quiz application. The initial plan is to develop this 
trivia app in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To be more specific, our team plans to use these particular web technologies:

HTML5 (BootStrap 4)
CSS3 (BootStrap 4)
JavaScript (KnockoutJS)

In closing, I feel through our teams collabrative efforts, communication, and idea creation, this repository will be
the ongoing development hub to display our growth as a team. I look forward to seeing our team work it's magic week 
by week to ultimately achieving our end result, a beautifully completed fully functional JavaScript trivia quiz SPA
application!

Thank you,

Aaron Wilson
